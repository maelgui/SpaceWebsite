EPresence is a school project of mobile application. We had to create an app capable of managing attendance sheet, in order to avoid using paper, and automate attendance entry in shcool software.

In order to satify teacher with both iPhone or Android device, we've chosen to use React Native from Facebook.

The app uses a SQLite database, and export data to XML or PDF.
